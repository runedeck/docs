# Spec-Driven Change Lifecycle

## Context and Problem Statement

Decision records capture why a choice stands, and nothing captured what must hold. Behavior lived in prose, drifted with it, and review had no target to test. Every runedeck repository needs one change lifecycle in which requirements are stated, validated, and merged into one canonical truth. This crate implements that lifecycle and kept its own tree under `docs/openspec/` with a `spec.root` override, the one layout the decision rules out.

## Considered Options

1. A free-form design document for each change.
2. The [OpenSpec][OPENSPEC] lifecycle: a proposal with Why and What Changes, a delta specification for each capability, and an archive into one canonical spec tree.

## Decision Outcome

Option 2.

- A change MUST live under `docs/changes/<id>/` with a proposal, a task list, and a delta specification for each capability.
- A requirement MUST use MUST language with at least one WHEN and THEN scenario.
- Archive MUST merge the delta into `docs/specs/` and MUST move the change directory to `docs/changes/archive/`. The canonical tree is the one truth.
- Archive is the act that accepts a change. OpenSpec has no status field and no accepted state, and this repository adds none. Archive MUST NOT run for a change without a record.
- `rune spec` is the native implementation over `docs/`, and the OpenSpec CLI operates on the same tree. One tree serves both, with no mirror.
- A repository MUST NOT carry an `openspec/` or `docs/openspec/` tree beside `docs/`, and MUST NOT set `spec.root` to move the tree elsewhere. `rune spec import --openspec` brings a stray tree home.
- Validation has layers: the spec grammar through the spec tooling, the document frame through mdschema, and the prose through the chosen linters.

## Consequences

- Review has a target it can test, and each requirement can name the check that enforces it.
- A small change carries the full ceremony: a proposal, a delta, and a record. The owner chose that cost, because a record states what the change wants.
- The `status` field in a proposal is a note for readers. The tools read task checkboxes and the archive location, so the field can disagree with them.
- `rune spec archive` matches requirement headings by exact text. A canonical heading that was recased by hand duplicates on the next archive. It does not yet move a record or assign an id, an open task in the cli repository.
- The change `openspec-store-compatibility`, which put this repository's tree under `docs/openspec/` for the OpenSpec CLI, is archived as abandoned: the OpenSpec CLI reads the native tree through `rune spec export`, not a second root.
